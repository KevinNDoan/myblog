            This blog was handcrafted with code, coffee, and love. It launched at the beginning of 2021 from my bedroom, roughly six months after starting my company. The goal of <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Choose to be Extraordinary</span> is to track my ideas, beliefs, and adventures for my retrospection in the future, and entertainment or education for you, the reader.
