### The first month
It was about a year ago that I had the idea to start Talkframer (at the time, named Hirola), a service similar to Craigslist or Ebay where users could buy and sell goods and services locally. I took a shining to the idea of the user being in control; that where ever they may end up, they got there on their own accord. I naively believed that I could slice a corner of this already densely populated market with subpar progamming skills and a common sensical idea. One week in, 15 days in, one month in, I was bored of the idea, frustrated by how dfficult coding was and how much I depended on it for the company's success. It was a kick to the shin.

### The drawing board
Observing the pit that I had dug for myself and reflecting inwards on my principles, I pivoted. The new idea? Well, if everything went smoothly, you may find yourself reading this for the sole reason that I birthed and helmed this idea into the world, and that I had gained just enough fame for you to look me up.

The company started of as SLVIR LLCâ€”I had wanted the domain name silver.com and the SEO leverage of being obscure, so SLVIR it was. In retrospect, this was an obviously terrible name on account of the fact that:
1. No one knows how to pronounce SLVIR (pronounced sliver).
2. When searching for SLVIR, search engines would recommend you see the results for silver under the assumption that SLVIR was a typo (not a lot of legitimacy points there).
3. The name had nothing to do with the company. Imagine the embarrassment when trying to explain this to your friends and family.

I renamed the company to Talkframer shortly after as a portmanteau of the company's cornerstones: talking and frames (a synonym for photos). Freshly christened with a pronounceable name, I set sail, advertising my ideas to my inner circle (I'll dive into more specifics about this in a later post) and much much later, to the world. With much of the major businessy puzzle pieces put together, I just had to code the darn thing.

### Building the plane midflight
Before starting my company, I had racked up basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, but was, for the most part, still a total novice. I realized quickly that you have to have iron goggles in this sport. My company was entirely predicated on this fact: If social media continues to exist and provide great utility, there at some point must be a social media platform that escapes the ethically questionable wholesale collection of data and the censorship of opposing ideas. My vision of a better future were the iron goggles that kept me motivated.

I started off analyzing good UXs and bad ones, UXs that took off and others that flopped, and with it all, I came to my own conclusions for how a realized Talkframer should feel. Immediately after getting "Hello World" to show up on a static HTML page, I began teaching myself full stack development... and I loved it. The work was simultaneously Safari expedition and FPS gaming; I was sucked into an ecstatic flow state by the risky slacklining nature of startups and the intense joy of visible, overnight growth. The plane had its blueprint and engineer in divine alignment.

### Conclusions
This is only the beginning. I'll continue to fervently build and champion my humanity first social network. I'm starry eyed and optimistic.
