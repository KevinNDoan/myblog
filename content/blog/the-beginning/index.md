### The first month
It was about a year ago that I had the idea to start Talkframer. It started of as Hirola, a service similar to that of Craigslist or Ebay where users can buy and sell goods and services locally. I took a shining to the idea of the user being in control, that where ever they may end up on my website, they got there on their own accord. I naively believed that I could slice a corner of this already densely populated market with subpar progamming skills and a common sensical idea. one week in, 15 days in, one month in, I was bored of the idea and frustrated by how little hollow my knowledge base was and how much I depended on it—it was kick to the shins.

### The drawing board
Observing the pit that I had dug for myself and reflecting inwards on my principles, I pivoted. The new idea? Well, if everything went smoothly, you may find yourself reading this for the sole reason that I birthed and helmed this idea into the world, and that I had gained some 5 seconds of fame, just enough for you to look me up.

The company started of as SLVIR LLC—I had wanted the domain name silver.com and the SEO leverage of being obscure, so SLVIR it was. In retrospect, this was an obviously terrible name on account of the fact that:
1. No one knows how to pronounce SLVIR (pronounced sliver).
2. When searching for SLVIR, search engines would recommend you see the results for silver under the assumption that SLVIR was a typo (not a lot of legitimacy points there).
3. The name had nothing to do with the company. Imagine the embarrassment in trying to explain this to your friends and family.

I renamed the company to Talkframer shortly after as a portmanteau of the company's cornerstones: talking and frames (a synonym for photos). Freshly christened with a pronounceable name, I set sail, advertising my ideas to my inner circle (I'll dive into more specifics about this in a later post) and much much later, to the world. With much of the major businessy puzzle pieces put together, I just had to code the darn thing.

### Building the plane midflight
Before starting my company, I had racked up basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, but was, for the most part, clueless on how or where to even begin. I realized quickly that you have to have iron goggles in this sport. My company was entirely predicated on this fact: If social media continues to exist and provide a great amount of utility, there at some point must be a social media platform that escapes the ethically quesitonable wholesale gathering of data and the censorship of opposing ideas. My vision of a better future were my iron goggles.

I set off analyzing good UXs and bad ones, UXs that took off and others that flopped, and with it all, I came to my own conclusions for how a realized Talkframer should feel—I had just vividly painted my future. With no experience beyond "Hello World" on static HTML page, I began teaching myself full stack development... and I loved it. The work was simultaneously Safari expedition and FPS gaming; I was sucked into an ecstatic flow state by the risky slacklining nature of startups and the intense joy of visible, overnight growth. The plane had its blueprint and engineer in divine alignment.

### Conclusions
This is only the beginning. I'll continue to fervently champion humanity. I'm starry eyed and optimistic.
