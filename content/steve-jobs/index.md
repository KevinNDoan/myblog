Among the tech revolutionaries that have personally impacted my life, I can’t think of any figure more consequential than Steve Jobs. His reputation as a genius and titan of innovation stand nil to his real masterpiece, his most fervent mission: Make the best product possible. With his time at Pixar and Apple, he’s left a legendary trail of lessons for us to follow, a guide to leaving behind greatness. But, as the reputation of his career surpasses, so do his mistakes and the eerie tales of his boardroom temper. I’ve had the greatest privilege to read Walter Isaacson’s biography and the following are the greatest lessons I’ve garnered from it.

I had originally planned to launch Talkframer at the end of my 2020 summer. As that deadline neared, the magnitude of Talkframer’s incompleteness dawned on me. It was an inflection point for the company; Should I end the project and make room for the coming academic year? Or, should I shoulder both responsibilities and pursue what I believed to be a righteous mission? Needless to say, I chose the latter, and it was in the coming months that I’d realized the truth of Jobs’s statement. When I was academically in the trenches, writing code and running Talkframer, something I originally believed might be burdensome, became my saving grace. It was my reward and privilege at the end of a tough day to journey onwards.
