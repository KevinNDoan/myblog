Among the tech revolutionaries that have personally impacted my life, I can’t think of any figure more consequential than Steve Jobs. His reputation as a genius and titan of innovation stand nil to his real masterpiece, his most fervent mission: Make the best product possible. With his time at Pixar and Apple, he’s left a legendary trail of lessons for us to follow, a guide to leaving behind greatness. But, as the reputation of his career surpasses, so do his mistakes and the eerie tales of his boardroom temper. I’ve had the greatest privilege to read Walter Isaacson’s biography and the following is a short list of lessons I’ve garnered.

<br>

# 1. The journey is the reward

Running the time machine back to roughly two years before the launch of the Macintosh, Steve Jobs, running off the success of the Apple II, craved another innovation. The computers of this period are most analogous to today’s computer terminals. To use a computer, one would have to type green-lettered, memorized commands into a black screen. There were no rounded corners, windows, cursors, desktops, or any other of the UI elements we enjoy today.

Following a deal between Apple and Xerox, Jobs was invited to the now legendary Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). There, while being introduced to bitmapped displays and the mouse, he had an epiphany: Why don’t all computers look like this? With a small handpicked class of 50 engineers, Jobs sought to realize that epiphany. Speaking to the importance of their mission, Jobs espoused, “The journey is the reward.” It’s with this empowering message that Jobs transformed his ragtag Mac team into a self-feeding force of nature.

I had originally planned to launch Talkframer at the end of my 2020 summer. As that deadline neared, the magnitude of Talkframer’s incompleteness dawned on me. It was an inflection point for the company; Should I end the project and make room for the coming academic year? Or, should I shoulder both responsibilities and pursue this nascent adventure? Needless to say, I chose the latter, and it was in the coming months that I’d realized the truth of Jobs’s statement. When I was academically in the trenches, writing code and running Talkframer—which I originally believed might be burdensome—actually became my saving grace. It was my reward and privilege at the end of a tough day; it kept me sane and sanguine.

# 2. Have a grand vision

What do most onlooking consumers want to hear? Here’s a hint: it’s not another CPU statistic or benchmark score. People need a message, a rallying cry to a grand vision, a bold message that speaks to the heart and its inherent optimism—and that goes for me too.

The “Think Different” campaign was just that. Succinct and audacious. It painted the Apotheosis of Apple with Gandhi, Edison, Martin Luther King Jr., Amelia Earhart, and co. at its center. A league of greats sharing the Apple vision, and to that effect, a league of consumers rushing to claim the same. I think this line sums it up brilliantly, “Jobs was able to encourage people to define themselves as anticorporate, creative, innovative rebels simply by the computer they used.”

“Choose to be extraordinary” was my perennial and mental mainstay. As “Think Different” indoctrinated worldwide consumers into the Apple brand, so too did “Choose to be extraordinary” indoctrinate me into my own brand. That echoing cry animates my exhausted body out of bed, summons forth the clacking of my fingers against the keyboard, and fueling my curiosity to venture further down the unpaved road. When I think of those words, I’m overcome with an all-consuming pride for what I’ve accomplished—not in an egotistical fashion that praises me superior, but more like a mental pat on the back that simultaneously whispers “good work” and yells “keep going!”

I have to attribute almost all of my successes in the past 2 years to this idea. Adopting a “Choose to be extraordinary” posture from sunup till sundown. Sometimes, it takes just one quote, one slogan, one word to inspire.

# 3. Don’t be trapped by dogma

In his Stanford Commencement Address, Jobs loosed this line, “Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.” In a world that is so often filled with societal expectations, it’s incentivized that we forgo our deepest callings, but that mindset doesn’t result in paradigm shifts.

This audacity: “‘Guys, you’ve killed yourselves over this design for the last nine months, but we’re going to change it,’ Jobs told Ive’s team.” is what drives change in the world. That comfort with drastically shifting course—doing away with the physical keyboard, the tiny screen, the “smart” OS—is an honest expression of the human spirit. Through doing this, we also attain the added bonus of insensing our teams with a trailblazing ardor. It’s with this rationale that we may gird ourselves for the corrupting forces of the world and produce something of substance, not of dogma.

It’s an insurmountable task to boil down inspiring lessons from Steve Jobs into a single article, so that’s why, even though you, the reader, have read this post, I still compel you to pick this godsend up and give it a read. If you aren’t deeply stirred by its telling—and many times deeply relatable—anecdotes, there’s something wrong with you.
